    text: What I most admire is the way the writer managers to catch a low key
      affection or generosity in her people. Finding it here in stories which
      otherwise are tough as nails, it's a generosity, even a sweetness, which
      is found only in the very best writers—Chekov, Jean Rhys, Alice Munro, a
      few others—although it's everywhere in life ... So I read these pieces and
      think, Yes, that's how it is. That's exactly how it is.
